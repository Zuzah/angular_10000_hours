# RxjsAndObservables

This section will cover RxJS, Observables, and RxJS Operators (pipe, map, tap)

## RxJS Operators

<b>map:</b> Is used to transform the emitted item from a subscribed data stream

<b>tap:</b> Is used to 'tap' into the stream without modifying it. Often used for logging

<b>take:</b> Is used to emit a specified number of items from a subscribed data stream and then completes
